# Project status

Updated 2026-08-01. Reflects what has actually been run and verified on
disk, not what is intended.

## Completed and verified

- **Pushed to GitHub**: `https://github.com/ynot-tony1/schoolscope-england`
  (public). CI is green on `main`
  (`https://github.com/ynot-tony1/schoolscope-england/actions/runs/30715283514`):
  Ingestor (ruff, mypy, pytest, docker build), Secret scan, Web (lint,
  typecheck, unit tests, build) all passed for real, on GitHub's own
  runners, not just locally. Fixed two real CI bugs to get there: the
  `gitleaks-action` push-diff mode fails on a repository's first push
  (replaced with a direct `gitleaks detect` full-history scan), and
  `prettier --check` had never actually passed since the initial commit
  (ran `prettier --write` for the first time, added `.prettierignore` for
  the lockfile/generated output/a test fixture).
- **Vercel project linked**: `vercel link` created and linked
  `tony-f5c4/schoolscope-england` for `apps/web`.
- **`aqua-roach` bootstrapped and migrated for real.**
  `scripts/bootstrap-cockroachdb.sh` was run against the live cluster:
  `school_intelligence` created, three least-privilege users created
  (`school_migrator`, `school_ingestor`, `school_app`) with the grants
  from `docs/database.md`, `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL`/
  `INGEST_DATABASE_URL` written to GitHub secrets, `DATABASE_URL` written
  to Vercel (Production and Preview). Found and fixed two real bugs in
  the script in the process: `CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS` silently skips
  the password clause on an already-existing user, breaking re-runs
  (fixed with an unconditional `ALTER USER ... WITH PASSWORD` after); and
  the Vercel commands ran from the repo root instead of `apps/web`, where
  the actual project link lives (fixed with `--cwd`).

  The `migrate-production` workflow then took several real attempts to
  get right, each a genuine bug caught by actually running it against
  production, not something guessed in advance:
  1. `prisma migrate status` exits 1 whenever migrations are pending,
     which is the normal state before every deploy; the workflow treated
     that as a hard failure and never reached the deploy step.
  2. CockroachDB Cloud creates new tables with `schema_locked = true` by
     default (a changefeed-performance feature this project does not
     use), which blocks the `ADD CONSTRAINT` foreign-key statements
     Prisma generates afterward.
  3. The first fix attempt (`ALTER TABLE ... SET (schema_locked =
     false)` right before the foreign keys) still failed intermittently:
     that ALTER triggers an async CockroachDB schema-change job, and
     Prisma's engine does not wait for it to finish before sending the
     next statement, unlike `psql`. Fixed properly by setting
     `schema_locked = false` directly in each `CREATE TABLE ... WITH
     (...)` statement, so the table is never locked in the first place.
  4. Recovering from the partially-applied migration needed a temporary,
     explicitly-confirmed reset workflow (dropped the 12 tables, then
     separately the 5 enum types, since `DROP TABLE` does not cascade to
     types a column used, and CockroachDB does not implement `DROP TYPE
     ... CASCADE` at all). Deleted once no longer needed.
  Verified independently afterward via read-only queries: 13 tables
  (12 plus `_prisma_migrations`), both foreign keys on `schools` present,
  all indexes present, migration tracking row shows a clean success. The
  `postcode_cache` grant to `school_app` that the bootstrap script had to
  defer (the table did not exist yet) now runs as a permanent step in
  `migrate-production.yml` after every deploy, using the least-privilege
  `school_migrator` credential, not the admin one.

  Every one of the diagnostic/recovery steps above ran through GitHub
  Actions using the already-stored `MIGRATION_DATABASE_URL` secret; the
  real database credentials were never read, held, or handled directly
  in this session, only ever passed through as opaque secret references.

- **Monorepo baseline is green.** `pnpm install`, `pnpm -r typecheck`,
  `pnpm -r lint`, `pnpm -r test`, and a real
  `pnpm --filter @schoolscope/web build` (Next.js production build, fake
  local `DATABASE_URL` so Prisma can generate its client) all pass. Test
  counts: `packages/shared` 39, `apps/web` 29, `services/ingestor` 45.
- **Every app route from the original spec now exists and is wired to the
  database** (degrading gracefully via `safeQuery` when unreachable, never
  a 500 page):
  - `/` home dashboard (live counts, ISR hourly).
  - `/schools` search (name/postcode/status filters, keyset pagination,
    distance-from-point sort) and `/schools/[urn]` detail (address, trust,
    local authority, de-duplicated latest-per-metric performance table).
  - `/trusts` and `/trusts/[id]`.
  - `/local-authorities` and `/local-authorities/[code]` (admissions
    links, catchment source list, schools in that authority).
  - `/admissions`: postcode + phase catchment check, calling
    `/api/admissions/check`, rendering the mandatory disclaimer text
    verbatim and, when applicable, the near-boundary warning. The status
    vocabulary and copy were written to only ever use the six allowed
    `CatchmentCheckStatus` values, matching the forbidden-word test
    already in `packages/shared`.
  - `/map`: MapLibre view, schools loaded live for the current viewport
    via `/api/map/schools`; `/api/map/catchments` also exists for
    boundary overlays once catchment data exists.
  - `/about/data`, `/status` (DB connectivity, git SHA, last 10 ingestion
    runs).
  - API routes: `/api/schools`, `/api/trusts`, `/api/local-authorities`,
    `/api/admissions/check` (rate-limited via the existing
    `lib/rate-limit.ts`), `/api/map/schools`, `/api/map/catchments`. All
    Node runtime, all using the shared safe-error-envelope helpers.
- **Query layer** (`apps/web/lib/queries/`): `schools.ts`, `trusts.ts`,
  `local-authorities.ts`, `catchments.ts`. Catchment checking does a
  bounding-box prefilter then exact point-in-polygon via the existing
  `lib/geo.ts` Turf helpers, distinguishes
  `OFFICIAL_BOUNDARY_NOT_AVAILABLE` from `ACADEMIC_YEAR_NOT_AVAILABLE`
  using the existing `packages/shared` catchment-source-registry helpers,
  and flags `POSTCODE_RESULT_NEAR_BOUNDARY` using the configured warning
  distance, matching the spec's admissions-safety rules.
- **Toolchain compatibility fixes** made while establishing the baseline
  (see git history for detail): TypeScript pinned to `~6.0.3` in
  `apps/web`/`packages/shared` (TS 7 not yet supported by
  `typescript-eslint`); `apps/web` ESLint rewritten onto
  `eslint-config-next`'s native flat-config exports and pinned to
  `~9.39.5` (ESLint 10 breaks `eslint-plugin-react`); `next.config.ts`'s
  removed `eslint.dirs` option (Next.js 16 dropped built-in ESLint
  integration); a zod v4 tuple-pipe type error in
  `packages/shared/src/schemas/common.ts`; a Turf `MultiPolygon` handling
  bug in `apps/web/lib/geo.ts`; and a real `.gitignore` bug that left the
  generated Prisma client, including a native binary, untracked but
  unignored (actual `output` path is `packages/database/generated`, not
  `packages/database/prisma/generated`).
- **`services/ingestor/Dockerfile` verified end-to-end**: `docker build`
  succeeds, and `docker run schoolscope-ingestor:local --help` shows the
  expected CLI (`discover-gias`, `import-gias`, `import-trusts`,
  `import-statistics`, `import-catchments`, `import-admissions`,
  `refresh-metrics`, `verify`, `cleanup`, `run`). The local test image was
  removed after verification; nothing was pushed anywhere.
- **`services/ingestor`** full check suite still passes: `ruff check .`,
  `mypy src` (13 files), `pytest -q` (45 tests).

## Unfinished

- **No Vercel deployment verified yet.** `DATABASE_URL` is set on Vercel
  and the production schema exists, but no build/deploy has actually been
  triggered or checked in this session.
- **No data imported.** All 12 production tables exist and are empty.
  `scripts/calibration-report.md` is still an unfilled template; do not
  run a full national import before it is filled in from a real pilot
  run.
- **Playwright end-to-end tests do not exist yet** (`playwright.config.ts`
  is present but there is no `tests/e2e/` content). Not attempted this
  session; would need a running app and, for full coverage, real data.
- **`/map`'s catchment overlay is wired but unused**: `/api/map/catchments`
  works, but the map page does not yet render a toggle to show catchment
  polygons on top of school points. Schools-only view is functional.

## Known failing tests

None. Every test suite that was run passed: `packages/shared` (39),
`apps/web` (29), `services/ingestor` (45).

## Exact next steps, in order

1. Verify a Vercel deployment now that `DATABASE_URL` is set and the
   production schema exists.
2. Run the bounded pilot import, fill in `scripts/calibration-report.md`
   with real numbers, get explicit go-ahead before any larger import.
3. Verify a real production deployment end-to-end against the acceptance
   criteria in the original spec.
4. Optional polish once the above is live: catchment overlay toggle on
   `/map`, Playwright e2e coverage for the golden paths (search a school,
   check a postcode, view the map).
